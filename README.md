## Java streams

### Asynchronous streams
Java Asynchronous Streams is a feature that allows you to process a large amount of data in a more efficient and flexible way. Imagine you have a massive collection of data (like a list of numbers) that you want to work with, but doing it all at once could take a long time and make your program slow.

With Asynchronous Streams, you can break down this big collection into smaller chunks, and then process those chunks independently and concurrently, meaning at the same time. It's like having multiple workers working on different parts of the data simultaneously, which speeds things up.

Here's how it works in simple terms:

**Splitting the data**: First, you take your big collection of data and divide it into smaller pieces. Each piece is called a "stream."

**Asynchronous processing**: Instead of handling one stream at a time, you process these streams asynchronously. This means you can deal with multiple streams concurrently. It's like multitasking for your program.

**Independent processing**: Each stream is processed independently of the others. So, if one stream takes a bit longer to process, it won't slow down the others.

**Merging the results**: Once all the streams are processed, you can combine their results back together to get your final output. Since you processed them simultaneously, it should be faster than processing the entire collection all at once.

The key benefits of using Asynchronous Streams are improved performance and responsiveness in your Java programs when dealing with large datasets.

In Java, you can work with Asynchronous Streams using methods like map, filter, flatMap, and collect from the Stream API, and you can leverage features like CompletableFuture and ExecutorService to manage the asynchronous processing.

### Boxing and unboxing
Boxing and unboxing are concepts related to converting between primitive data types and their corresponding wrapper classes in Java. These wrapper classes are part of the Java API and allow primitive types to be treated as objects.

**Boxing**: Boxing is the process of converting a primitive data type into its corresponding wrapper class object. In Java, primitive data types (like int, double, char, etc.) are not objects and don't have methods associated with them. However, sometimes we might need to treat them as objects, like when using certain Java collections that can only store objects.

For example, suppose you have an int variable and you want to store it in an ArrayList, which can only store objects. You need to box the int value into an Integer object to do so. The process of converting the int to an Integer is called boxing.
```
int num = 42;            // primitive int
Integer boxedNum = num; // boxing: converting int to Integer
```
**Unboxing**: Unboxing is the opposite process of boxing. It involves converting a wrapper class object back into its corresponding primitive data type. This is necessary when you want to extract the actual value from the wrapper object.

For example, if you have an Integer object and you need to perform some arithmetic operation with it, you first need to unbox it to get the primitive int value.
```
Integer boxedNum = 42;     // Integer object
int num = boxedNum;        // unboxing: converting Integer to int
```

In summary, boxing allows you to convert primitive types to their wrapper objects, while unboxing allows you to convert wrapper objects back to their primitive types. These conversions are done automatically by the Java compiler when needed, and they make it easier to work with primitive types in situations where objects are required, such as using Java collections or other APIs that work with objects. However, it's essential to be aware of these conversions, as they can have performance implications if done excessively in critical sections of code.

### Collecting
In the context of Java streams, collecting refers to the process of gathering the elements of a stream into a data structure, like a list, set, or map. The Stream API provides the collect() method, which allows you to perform this operation and accumulate the stream elements into a collection or a custom container.

Here's how collecting works in Java streams in simple terms:

**Stream Creation**: First, you create a stream from a data source, such as a list or an array.

**Intermediate Operations**: You can perform various intermediate operations on the stream, like filtering, mapping, or sorting. These operations transform the elements in the stream but do not produce any final results.

**Terminal Operation - Collecting**: After applying any intermediate operations, you use the collect() method to perform a terminal operation. This operation gathers the elements of the stream and collects them into a collection or a custom container.

For example, let's say you have a list of names and you want to collect them into a new list that contains only the names starting with the letter "A":

```
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Anna", "Alex");
List<String> namesStartingWithA = names.stream()
                                     .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A"))
                                     .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

In this example, we first created a stream from the names list, then used the filter() method to keep only the names starting with "A," and finally used the collect() method to gather the filtered names into a new list called namesStartingWithA.

Java provides various built-in collectors in the Collectors class, which offer additional functionalities for collecting elements. For instance, you can use Collectors.toSet() to collect elements into a set, or Collectors.groupingBy() to create a map grouping elements based on a specific criterion.

Collecting is a powerful feature of the Stream API that allows you to transform and process data from a stream into more useful and structured data representations, making it easier to work with and manipulate large datasets in a concise and expressive manner.
